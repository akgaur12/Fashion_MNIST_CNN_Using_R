# Fashion MNIST Classification using CNN in R

This repository contains code for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in R for classifying the Fashion MNIST dataset. The CNN is designed to recognize and classify different fashion items.

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, including T-shirts, trousers, sneakers, and more. It serves as a benchmark for machine learning models in the fashion domain.

## Prerequisites
- R programming environment
- RStudio (optional but recommended)
